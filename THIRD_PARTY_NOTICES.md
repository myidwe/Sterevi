The Preview host is the newly rebuilt executable with SHA-256 `86eb2ee5e3177a892f15ecd5ba869b27d3e1b9131848b1adacf9a25301767d42`. Its modified Sunshine source archive, all initialized submodule inputs, exact dependency sources/recipes, toolchain lock and executed build helpers are supplied together. The host source, native/web build and original dependency notices have been checked against this executable. The preserved historical development executable and its partial source snapshot are separate inputs and are not claimed to be this Preview binary's corresponding source.

The new Quest Preview APK uses freshly built project, stream, XR, modified Godot and public-header OpenXR vendor inputs. Compatible official editor/template, Android Maven and NDK inputs remain version/hash pinned. Their applicable source and original notices are supplied; this is not a claim that every untouched tool or compiler runtime was recompiled. The GPL-enabled native stream is part of the combined GPL app. Historical preview-header references retained in source evidence do not describe the headers selected for the new vendor binary.

Detailed files in the downloads:

- Desktop ZIP: `artifacts/host/runtime-public/notices/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `dependency-notices.json` and the adjacent original notice trees. They include the actual host-linked libraries and production web dependencies.
- Quest ZIP: `notices/quest/NOTICES.md` and `notices/quest/licenses/`, including Godot, OpenXR, NDK, native dependency and Android module texts.
- Matching Source ZIP: `sources/sunshine/SOURCE.md`, `sources/sunshine/provenance.json` and `sources/sunshine/notices/`; `sources/quest/SOURCE_BUILD_NOTES.md`, `sources/quest/source-manifest.json`, `sources/quest/NOTICES.md` and `sources/quest/licenses/`. These identify the corresponding binary, exact build inputs and supplied source archives.

Use the Source ZIP attached to the **same Release** as the downloaded Desktop/Quest ZIPs. GitHub's automatically generated repository source ZIP is not a substitute for this complete native source/dependency package. The release review compares the actual distributed notice bytes with their corresponding Source ZIP bytes. Build/source/notice checks are separate from installation, headset, audio and long-run verification; the Release notes state those practical limits. No signing private key, pairing record or user's media is included. APK signing certificates are public verification material.

The installer downloads unmodified, hash-pinned public PyPI Qt wheels into an ordinary virtual environment; Qt DLLs are dynamically loaded and are not embedded into a locked executable. Their original wheel metadata/files are retained, and the user can inspect or replace the libraries. The distributed Quest3D Python/QML source is GPLv3. PySide/shiboken source is the upstream v6.8.3 tag; Qt module sources use v6.8.3. The listed wheel and license pins remain unchanged by the native Preview rebuild.
